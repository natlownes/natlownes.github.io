title: Wooden Replacement Enter key for Kinesis Keyboard

I broke the "enter" key on my Kinesis keyboard yesterday.  I didn't have any
super glue to fix the original key, but did have some scrap wood, basic woodworking tools, a Dremel, sandpaper, some polyurethane, and some time.  I think this outcome was much more satisfying anyway.

I used a manual miter saw to cut the basic shape then used the Dremel and
hand sandings to shape it further.

I cut the cross-shaped mounting carvings shown here using a Dremel carving bit that was about the
width of the plastic cross pieces that had to slip into the wood, maybe a little bit
smaller.  I eyed it up (out of impatience, not skill mind you) with the key I was
replacing sitting on the workbench for reference.

The wood around the mounting cross (the bit that has to slip down into
the key mechanism) was then shaped using a sanding bit at 10k rpm, not pressing down
with much force.

At first I was going to keep it rectangular-ish, but found the edge of my thumb
being irritated since I'd nudge the edge of the key going between space and
enter.  Here's the initial shape:

Hand sanded it down to have a slanted shape that would allow for faster transfer
of the thumb from enter to space.  Used a superfine painter's sander for the
finishing sanding.

Took about a day for it to dry.  Here's the finished product:

After a day of using it, I'm pretty happy with it; the setup of the enter and
space keys on the Kinesis always *slightly* irritated my thumb since I'd graze the
edge of the concave enter key on the way to the space key.  I'm excited to have
a convex key in that spot.

Something I don't like is that the finished product isn't silky, silky smooth.  Not
sure if there's a way to solve that, but being one who unknowingly pounds the
fuck out of keyboards I think I'll have plenty more opportunities for practice.
