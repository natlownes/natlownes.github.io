#### Introduction

Sending images as a response to something, i.e. "reaction gifs" is a funny thing
that happens on the Internet about things sometimes.  Often what's even funnier
than the image itself is the URL of the image.

This web app will take arbitrary text, make a very plain image of that exact
text, and attempt to return that image, stored at a (perhaps) relevant and
(perhaps) humorous URL.

The impetus for this entire nonsense was the fantastic URL of:
**http://www.funnycatsite.com/pictures/Very_Interesting250.jpg**

There's no part of that URL (or potential interactions with that URL) that isn't
funny to me.

#### Use Case

Definitely none.

Or, waitaminute.  You might want to use this if you want to make a joke about a
URL.  Or if you want an image of the text you might search in your quest to find
a reaction gif:

* [http://timg.narf.io/g?t=rasta man huge doob](http://timg.narf.io/g?t=rasta%20man%20huge%20doob)

#### Interface

The only interface to this stupid joke is your browser's address bar.  There are
two options:

* Just show me the image:  using the "i" [query
  param](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string):
[http://timg.narf.io/i?t=http://funnycatsite.com/pictures/Very_Interesting250.jpg](http://timg.narf.io/i?t=http://funnycatsite.com/pictures/Very_Interesting250.jpg)
* Try to make a humorous URL:  using the "g" query param:
[http://timg.narf.io/g?t=http://funnycatsite.com/pictures/Very_Interesting250.jpg](http://timg.narf.io/g?t=http://funnycatsite.com/pictures/Very_Interesting250.jpg)

Using the "g" param will redirect you to a (hopefully) humorous URL with an
image of your text.  It may be different with each request.
