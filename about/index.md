My name is Nat and this is a blog about coding computers to do things.

I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and freelance as a Ruby,
Javascript/Coffeescript, and [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) developer.
Fully expecting to go nuts on [docker](http://docker.io/) very shortly.  Dipping
into Go and Haskell at the moment in addition to hacking on personal projects.

I've worked thoroughly on Ruby on Rails applications and authored several
plugins for that framework that are in use in production environments.  Also
kept large, inherited, mysterious systems running and deployed and maintained
applications on bare metal machines and several PaaS providers.

I am available for hire on a contract basis, [don't hesitate to contact me for
a quote for your project](mailto:nat.lownes@gmail.com?subject=availability) or just to ask questions.
